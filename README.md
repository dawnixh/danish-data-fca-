How the binarisation was achieved.
We are binarizing the dataset by applying One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables, which creates binary columns for each category, and by using the KBinsDiscretizer to transform continuous variables (such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol) into discrete bins. The KBinsDiscretizer divides each continuous feature into a specified number of equal-width intervals, based on the range of the data. For example, if the range of a feature is 0 to 200 and we specify 2 bins, the discretizer would create two bins: one for values between 0-100 and the other for values between 101-200. It then assigns each value within those intervals an ordinal value (e.g., 0 for the first bin, 1 for the second, etc.), effectively transforming the continuous data into categorical representations. This approach helps in handling continuous variables by converting them into a fixed number of categories, making them more suitable for certain types of machine learning models. Both transformations are then added to the cleaned dataset.
